# AVD (Automated Vulnerabilies detection)
Using Joern (https://joern.io) and different methods to automate the detection of vulnerabilities

_First of all what is Joern?_

Joern is an open-source code analysis tool designed for security researchers, software developers, and penetration testers. Developed with a focus on identifying potential vulnerabilities in software codebases, Joern specializes in performing static code analysis to uncover security weaknesses early in the development lifecycle. Leveraging the power of graph database technology, Joern creates a semantic code graph that allows users to explore and visualize relationships within the code, making it an effective tool for understanding complex code structures.
